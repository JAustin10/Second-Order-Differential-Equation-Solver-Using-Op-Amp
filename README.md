# Second-Order-Differential-Equation-Solver-Using-Op-Amp
The operational amplifier circuit can solve mathematical problems such as differential equations. 
In the circuit two differentiator and one adder has been used.The equation used for the circuit is:
(dx<sup>2</sup>)/(dt<sup>2</sup>)+10dx/dt+6x=0
